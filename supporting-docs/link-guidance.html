<p>In this informative appendix we offer advice to OSLC Technical Committees on
    modeling links and relationships between OSLC resources.</p>
</section>

<section class="informative" id="RelationshipsinOSLC">

<h2>Relationships in OSLC</h2>

<p>The Core workgroup's guidance to OSLC domain workgroups is that
relationships are uni-directional and in most cases relationships
should be modeled as links. We offer two ways to express
relationships, a link and an anchor. Let's define those terms and
others that we will use in this document:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Relationship: a relationship is said to exist between two resources if there is something that connects them; they work together, belong together, are similar or should be considered together. There may be different types of relationships.
        <li>Link: a link is a URI reference from one resource, the subject or source, to another resource, said to be the object or target. In RDF and in OSLC we use links to model relationships and like relationships, links are uni-directional.

          <li>Anchor: an anchor is a mechanism for attaching property-values to a link, thus annotating a relationship with values that are about that relationship.
    </ol>

Now that we've defined our terminology, let's move on to expressing relationships.

</section>

<section class='informative' id="Expressingrelationships">
<h2>Expressing relationships for OSLC</h2>

<p>The RDF data model gives us a number of value-types to express
relationships, some more complex than others. We expect that the
majority of links will be expressed with the most simple option, URI
Reference or as it is known in conversation, a Link. For more complex
cases, when a relationship must be annotated with property-values, we
use what is called an Anchor, which is a link plus information that
annotates or labels that link. Read the sub-sections below for details
and examples of Links and Anchors.</p>

<section id="resources" id="Link">
<h3>Link</h3>
<strong>Link from subject to object</strong>
<p>
Use this when you need a simple link, you don't want to inline any summary of the target and you do not need to annotate the link with property values. Most relationships should be represented this way.
<p>
In RDF terminology, a link is called a URI Reference. In OSLC, you express a link as a property with OSLC value-type of Resource and OSLC representation of Reference. For example, here is a property terms:subscribesTo that you might find inside a customer resource, it links to a resource that is "subscribedTo" by the customer:

<p><strong>Example #1: relationship expressed as simple link (i.e. URI reference)</strong>
<pre class="example" id="eg1">
&lt;rdf:RDF
     xmlns:terms=&quot;http://example.com/terms/&quot;
     xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&gt;

    &lt;terms:Customer rdf:about=&quot;http://example.com/customers/4321&quot;&gt;
         &lt;terms:subscribesTo rdf:resource=&quot;http://example.com/magazines/Field_and_Stream&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/terms:Customer&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>

<h3> Don't make assumptions about the target of links</h3>
 Relationships in OSLC resources are at their simplest an RDF property
 whose object is a URI. In some cases within one system, it is
 necessary to require a closed link, i.e. require the object of a link
 be of one or more specific resource types. In general, it is better
 to be open like the web and not place restrictions on the type of
 resource linked to. The property's purpose and name should clearly
 reflect the scenarios it is supporting. Since the usage of these
 relationship properties may exist for a long period of time,
 specification authors should use great care in determining these.
<p>

As resources evolve over time, and they adapt to different situations,
different types will be exposed as targets to existing link
types. Well behaved clients should gracefully handle resource types
they don't expect when exercising links in resources. Well behaved
clients should gracefully handle resource types they don't expect when
exercising links in resources. Specifications should allow links to be
open ended (have any type, specifying Range any), and use text in the
property description to suggest expected types, without being
limiting. For example: “Change request affects a plan item. It is
likely that the target resource will be an oslc_cm:ChangeRequest but
that is not necessarily the case.” Some implementations may only work
well if the link object comes from a set of “known” or “expected”
types. The following graceful degradation sequence is suggested for
providers when an unexpected type is encountered:
<ol>
<li>If possible, tolerate the unexpected link target type and allow the client’s request to proceed normally.
<li>Else, if possible, allow the client’s request to proceed and include an informational message with the response.
<li>Else, fail the client’s request with the most appropriate 4xx Bad Request HTTP status code.
</ol>

<h2>Anchor</h2>
<strong>Local Resource holds link from subject to object plus property-values that annotate the relationship.</strong>
<p>
 Relationships are expressed as RDF triples and triples do not have
 property values - only resources have property values. Links are used
 to express relationships. Many relationships can be represented by a
 single link, but some relationships need to be annotated with
 property values. For example, if I am trying to represent the
 subscriber relationship between a customer and a magazine, I may need
 to record an expiration date for the relationship. To do this, we
 need to use an RDF concept known as reification. Reification is a way
 to make a statement about a statement. See RDF Syntax Specification
 Section 4: Statements about Statements for more information on this
 concept (reference: RDF Syntax).
<p>
Assuming the subscriber scenario, example #2 shows how you would use reification to express the annotation.
<p><strong>Example #2: Link as reified statement in RDF/XML format</strong>
<pre class="example" id="eg2">

    &lt;/terms:Customer&gt;

        &lt;terms:delivery rdf:resource=&quot;http://example.com/terms/online&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;rdf:subject rdf:resource=&quot;http://example.com/customers/4321&quot;/&gt;

        &lt;rdf:predicate rdf:resource=&quot;http://example.com/terms/subscribesTo&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;rdf:Statement rdf:about=&quot;#n2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;terms:expirationDate&gt;2010-01-22&lt;/terms:expirationDate&gt;
        &lt;terms:annualPriceUSD&gt;15.95&lt;/terms:annualPriceUSD&gt;
        &lt;terms:delivery rdf:resource=&quot;http://example.com/terms/mail&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;rdf:subject rdf:resource=&quot;http://example.com/customers/4321&quot;/&gt;

   &lt;/rdf:Statement&gt;

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
<p>
 But there is a better RDF/XML form, made possible by the rdf:ID
 attribute. OSLC implementations should prefer this next form because
 it is easier to read and easier to parse.

   &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;

&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
And here's how to express the same within the JSON format specified by
OSLC Core. Because we already represent value-type Resource as a JSON
object, we can simply add annotating property-values directly into
that. In this case, adding <code>terms:expirationDate</code> to the
<code>terms:subscribesTo</code> object.

<section class='informative' id="Antipattern">
<h2>Anti-pattern: Link with inlined values of target</h2>

With the OSLC query syntax it is possible to get query resources with
 links and for each link some inlined values from the target of the
 link. This allows a client to get links and some information from the
 target of each link in one HTTP request per page of results, saving
 the client the expense of dereferencing each link. This pattern is
 useful for query, but is not recommended in OSLC resource design.
<p>
Below is an example of a Blog Entry resource containing a link to an
uploaded-file resource of type <code>oslc_blog:UploadedFile</code> and
with the <code>dcterms:title</code> of that resource inlined. This
enables the client to know the type and title of the target resource
without having to HTTP GET it.
<pre class="example" id="eg5">
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:oslc_blog=&quot;http://open-services.net/ns/bogus/blog#
             xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;&gt;
     &lt;oslc_blog:Entry rdf:about=&quot;http://example.com/blogs/entry/5&quot;&gt;
        &lt;dcterms:title&gt;New Wink release available&lt;/dcterms:title&gt;
        &lt;!-- other property values --&gt;
        &lt;oslc_blog:attachment&gt;
           &lt;oslc_blog:UploadedFile rdf:about=&quot;http://example.com/attachments/2&quot;&gt;
             &lt;dcterms:title&gt;wink-0.9.6.jar&lt;/dcterms:title&gt;
           &lt;/oslc_blog:UploadedFile&gt;
        &lt;/oslc_blog:attachment&gt;
     &lt;/oslc_blog:BlogEntry&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;
</pre>
<p>
 In OSLC defined resource terminology, the property above is type
 Resource with representation Inline. The problem with this is that it
 adds redundant property-values to a resource. When you link to a
 target resource that has a dcterms:title value and you inline that
 dcterms:title in the subject resource, in the RDF data model this
 means that you have just given the object resource two titles. What
 if the titles do not match? Can a client change the title in the
 subject resource?
<p>
That brings us to the end of the guidance. Please provide feedback to
the OSLC Core Workgroup mailing-list.
