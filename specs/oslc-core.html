<h2>Introduction</h2>  

<p>Information Technology (IT) enterprises are constantly addressing demands
to do more with less. To meet this demand they need more efficient development
processes and supporting tools. This has resulted in strong demand for better
support of integrated system and software processes. Enterprises want
solutions (such as software or hardware development tools) from different
vendors, open source projects and their own proprietary components to work
together. This level of integration, however, can become quite challenging and
unmanageable. In order to enable integration between a heterogeneous set of
tools and components from various sources, there is a need for a sufficient
supporting architecture that is: loosely coupled, minimal, and
standardized. OSLC is based on World Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such
as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], to create a cohesive
set of specifications that can enable products, services, and other
distributed network resources to interoperate successfully. [[LDP]]</p>

<p>OSLC is motivated by domain-driven scenarios that inspire standardization
of common capabilities across disciplines such as change management,
requirements management, and quality management, as well as by cross-domain
scenarios such as Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) &amp; DevOps, Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM), and Integrated Service Management (ISM). Although
the OSLC approach may apply to many other domains and cross-domain scenarios,
it focuses on software lifecycle management to ensure it meets a core set of scenarios and requirements.</p>

<p>The OSLC Core specifications provide additional capabilities that expand on
the W3C LDP capabilities, as needed, to enable key integration scenarios. These capabilities define the essential and common technical elements of OSLC domain specifications and offers guidance on common concerns for creating, updating, retrieving, and linking to lifecycle resources based on W3C [[LDP]]. These specifications have emerged from the best practices and other work of other OSLC Member Section (MS)-affiliated Technical Committees (TCs), sometime referred to as OSLC domain TCs.  OSLC domain TCs focus on a certain domain or topic. The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/oslc-core/">OSLC Core TC</a> develops technical specifications, creates best practices documents and formulates design principles that can be leveraged by other OSLC MS-affiliated TCs to enable them to focus on domain-specific concerns.</p>

  <figcaption>OSLC Core 3.0 Overview</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As seen in <a href="#fig-oslc-core-3.0-overview"></a>, there are a number
of capabilities developed in different standards organizations, TCs and
working groups.  The arrows represent either dependencies or extensions to
some specifications or capabilities.  OSLC MS-affiliated TC developed
specifications may depend on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications as scenarios
motivate. However, a leading goal is to minimize and eliminate unnecessary
dependencies to simplify adoption, which may result in no dependency on OSLC
Core 3.0 specifications for some OSLC domains.</p>

<p>This work is an evolution from the OSLC Core 2.0 [[OSLCCore2]] efforts,
taking the experience gained from that effort along with the common
foundation on W3C LDP, to produce an updated set of specifications that are:
simpler, built on layered capabilities and easier to adopt.</p>

		<h2>Goals/Motivation</h2>
		<p>The primary goal of OSLC is to enable integration of federated, shared information across tools that support different, but related domains. OSLC was initially focused on development of Information Technology solutions involving processes, activities, work products and supporting tools for solution delivery and lifecycle management (SDLC). However, OSLC capabilities could be applicable to other domains. The specific goals for OSLC Core 3.0 are to build on the existing OSLC Core 2.0 specifications to further facilitate the development and integration of domains and supporting tools that address additional integration needs. Specifically:
		<ul>
			<li>Integration is based on an open standard, and not controlled by any single vendor</li>
			<li>OSLC 3.0 is based on the new W3C Linked Data Platform standard which provides a solid foundation for reading and writing linked data resources</li>
			<li>The specifications are simpler, more consistent and will potentially be more attractive to, and easier to consume by new integrations</li>
			<li>There are some new capabilities including Attachments, Inverse link labels, traceability and impact types</li>
			<li>Domain vocabularies can be improved for data consistency and removing data gaps</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>The following guiding principles were used to govern the evolution of OSLC and guide the development of the OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Scenario-driven</em>
		<p>Every capability should be linked back to
			key integration scenarios that motivate its need. These are important not only for knowing that the correct specification content is being developed but also to assist with implementers understanding the intended usage and in developing relevant test cases.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Incremental</em>
		<p>Specifications should be developed in an incremental fashion
			that not only validates the technical approaches but also delivers
			integration value sooner.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Loose-coupling</em>
		<p>Specifications should support a model where clients have little
			to no knowledge about server implementation-specific behaviors in
			order to support key integration scenarios. As a result, clients
			should be unaffected by any server application software
			or data model implementation changes. Similarly, client software should be able to be independently changed without changes to server software.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Minimalistic</em>
		<p>Specification authors should strive to find not only the
			simplest solution that would work for a given scenario but allows for easy adoption. Authors should avoid solutions that offer additional capabilities which may inhibit adoption of necessary capabilities.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Capability Based</em>
		<p>A capability is the ability to perform actions to achieve outcomes described by scenarios through the use of specific technologies. Capabilities should be incrementally defined as independent focused specifications and independently discovered at runtime. Even though there may be some generally agreed upon best practices for capability publication and discovery, each capability should define how it is published and discovered. The Core OSLC capabilities are defined in this specification.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Vocabularies</em>
		<p>Various OSLC MS-affiliated TCs, or any specification development body that is authoring specifications for specific domains of knowledge, should minimally define vocabularies and the semantics behind the various terms.  Some consideration should be given for global reuse when terms are used for cross domain queries and within
		other domain resource shape definitions. Domain specifications are
		the definition of an OSLC capability, and how those vocabulary terms are used in LDP interactions by both the clients and servers of that capability. The specification should include defining resource shapes that describe resources based on a set of vocabulary terms, which introduces any domain specific constraints on the vocabulary's usage.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		<p>In support of the previously stated goals and motivation, it is desired to have a consistent and recommended architecture. The architecture needs to support scenarios requiring a protocol to access, create, update and delete resources. [[LDP]] is the foundation for this protocol. Resources need to relate, or link, to one another utilizing a consistent, standard and web-scale data model. Resource Description Framework (RDF) [[rdf11-concepts]] is the foundation for this. The ability to work with these data models over HTTP protocols, is based on [[LDP]].  </p>

		<p>Some scenarios, require the need to integrate user interface components: either within a desktop or mobile web-browser, mobile device application, or rich desktop applications.  For these scenarios, the technology is rapidly evolving and changing.  Priority should be based on existing standards such as HTML5, with use of <code>iframe</code> and <code>postMessage()</code>. [[HTML5]]</p>

		<p>Various OSLC Core specification documents elaborate on the conformance requirements leveraging these various technologies and
		approaches.</p>

		<p>As the primary goals have been outlined around lifecycle integration, some scenarios may require exploration of new (or different) approaches and technologies.  As with all specification development efforts, the OSLC Core TC will advise, develop and approve
		such efforts through the established processes for cross-TC and organization coordination.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>OSLC Core 3.0 Capabilities</h2>
		<p>The following sections and referenced documents define the capabilities for OSLC Core 3.0. These documents comprise the multi-part specification for OSLC Core 3.0. They represent common capabilities that servers MAY provide and that may be discovered and used by clients. Although OSLC Core could be useful on its own, it is intended to specify capabilities that are common across many domains. Servers will generally specify conformance with specific domain specifications, and those domain specifications will describe what parts of OSLC Core are required for conformance. This allows servers to implement the capabilities they need in a standard way without the burden of implementing capabilities that are not required. The purpose of the OSLC Core Discovery capability is to allow clients to determine what capabilities are provided by a server. Any provided capability must meet all the conformance criteria for that capability as defined in the OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

		<p>This implies that any capability that is discoverable is essentially optional, and once discovered, the capability is provided as defined in the applicable OSLC specifications. Servers should support OSLC Discovery, but Discovery itself is also an optional capability as servers could provide other means of informing specific clients of supported OSLC capabilities that could be utilized directly. For example, a server might provide only preview dialogs on specific resources and nothing else.</p>

		<section id="authentication">
			<h2>Authentication</h2>
			<p>Authentication determines how a user of a client identifies themselves to a server to ensure the user has sufficient privileges to access resources from that server, and provides a mechanism for servers to control access to resources.
			</p>
			<section id="basic-auth"><h2 class="normalText">

			<h2>Resource Discovery</h2>
			<p>Resource <a href="http://tools.oasis-open.org/version-control/browse/wsvn/oslc-core/specs/discovery.html">Discovery</a> defines a common approach for HTTP/LDP-based servers to be able to publish their RESTful API capabilities and how clients can discover and use them.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="resourceRepresentations">
			<h2>Resource Representations</h2>
			<p> OSLC resource representations come in many forms and are subject to standard HTTP and mechanisms for content negotiation.</p>

			<p>OSLC domain specifications should specify the representations needed for the specific scenarios that they are addressing, and should recognize that different representations are appropriate for different purposes. For example, browser oriented scenarios might be best addressed by JSON or Atom format representations.</p>

			<p>OSLC domain specifications are also expected to follow common practices and conventions that are in concert with existing industry standards and offer consistency across domains. All of the OSLC specifications are built upon the standard RDF data model, allowing OSLC to align with the Linked-Data Platform [[LDP]]. In addition, all OSLC specifications have adopted the convention to illustrate RDF/XML representations and will typically require RDF/XML representations to enable consistency across OSLC implementations. </p>

				Because the update process may involve first getting a resource, modifying it and then later putting it back to the server, there is the possibility of a conflict, e.g. some other client may have have updated the resource since the GET. To mitigate this problem, OSLC Services SHOULD use the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header on a PUT request:
				<ul>
					<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is missing OSLC Services SHOULD return HTTP Bad Request (400) status code to indicate that the header is required.</li>
					<li>If the HTTP <code>If-Match</code> header is present OSLC Services MUST behave as described in the HTTP specification, returning an HTTP Precondition Failed (412) error to indicate that the header does not match.</li>

		</section>
		<section id="query">
			<h2>Query</h2>
			<p>OSLC servers will often manage large amounts of potentially complex link-data entities. Practical use of this information will require some query capability that minimally supports selection, projection and ordering. Ideally OSLC Core would rely on existing standard query services such as [[SPARQL]] that are integrated with [[LDP]]. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/ldql/">Linked Data Query Language Community Group</a> is currently working on a Query Language for [[LDP]]. However, the reality is that many OSLC servers are adapters built on existing data management capabilities that are not built on an RDF foundation and do not provide SPARQL endpoints for query. In order to address the need for standard query capability to enable integration, [[OSLCCore2]] introduced a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecQuery">Query Capability</a> and a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OSLCCoreSpecQuery">Query Syntax</a> that were intended to be simple enough that they could be implemented on a wide range of existing server architectures. In practice this has proven to be more difficult than anticipated. But the need is still there. OSLC Core 3.0 is built on [[LDP]] and future OSLC domain servers may provide more consistent access to SPARQL endpoints. Ofter time, that may lead to the deprecation of OSLC Core 2.0 Query Capability. In the meantime, OSLC Core 2.0 Query Capability is still available for OSLC domain specifications that need it.</p>
			<section id="queryCapability"><h2 class="normalText">
				OSLC Servers MAY support a <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Query_Capabilities">Query Capability</a> as defined in [[OSLCCore2]] to enable clients to perform selection and projection operations in order to retrieve a selected subset of resources and property values from an LDPC. For OSLC 3.0, every LDPC is considered an <code>oslc:queryBase</code> URI.  This capability is included to preserve compatibility with [[OSLCCore2]].

	<section id="versionCompatibility" class="informative">
		<h2>Version Compatibility</h2>
		<p>OSLC is intended to provide a foundation for (lifecycle) application interoperability. A significant number of OSLC domains, and client and server implementations already exist and are in common use. Interoperability issues between applications on incompatible OSLC versions could result in negative impact to end users. One of the goals of the OSLC initiative is to mitigate or eliminate the need for lock-step version upgrades, where clients or servers target one version of a specification and break when new versions are introduced -- requiring all services to be upgraded simultaneously.</p> 

		<p>OSLC Core and domain specifications will each be versioned independently, and may specify version numbers. Existing OSLC 2.0 clients and servers use the OSLC-Core-Version header described in <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning">OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a> to indicate what OSLC version they expect or support. But exposing version numbers in OSLC implementations could lead to interoperability issues. Ultimately each domain will decide its compatibility needs. However, OSLC Core 3.0 does not introduce any changes that would break existing OSLC 2.0 clients. Because of this, there is no need for OSLC Core 3.0 to require servers or clients to utilize an OSLC-Core-Version header with a value of 3.0.</p>

		<p>If an OSLC 2.0 client accesses an OSLC 3.0 server, the 3.0 server will always respond to the client in a manner that is compatible with 2.0. The response may include additional headers and entity request or response body information defined by OSLC Core 3.0, but this information will be simply ignored by the 2.0 clients. There will be no missing or invalid information since OSLC Core 3.0 is designed to be compatible with OSLC Core 2.0.</p>

		<p>For OSLC clients that access 2.0 servers:
			<ul>
				<li>OSLC 1.0 clients - get 1.0 responses by default from 2.0 servers and don't interoperate with 3.0 servers.</li>
				<li>OSLC 2.0 clients - interact with 2.0 servers that may or may not implement 1.0 by using the OSLC-Core-Version header.</li>
				<li>OSLC 3.0 Clients - if they are accessing 2.0 servers that might return 1.0 responses without the header, then they would have to provide the header as specified in <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning">OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a>,</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>OSLC Core 3.0 does not address compatibility with versions of OSLC prior to [[OSLCCore2]]. Servers wishing to support compatibility with versions prior to 2.0 should follow <a href="http://open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning">OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning</a>.</p>
