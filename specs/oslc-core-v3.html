		<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>With strong demand for better support of integrated system and software processes,
enterprises want solutions (such as software or hardware development tools) from different
 vendors, open source projects and their own
proprietary components to work together. This level of integration, however, can become
quite challenging and unmanageable. In order to support integration between a
heterogeneous set of tools and components from various sources, there is a need
for an architecture that has sufficient aspects: loosely coupled, minimal,
and has been standardized. OSLC
is based on World Wide Web and Linked Data principles, such as those defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform (LDP),
to create a cohesive set of specifications that can enable products, services, and
other distributed network resources to interoperate successfully. [[LDP]]</p>

<p>OSLC is motivated by domain-driven scenarios that inspire standardization of common
capabilities across disciplines such as change management, requirement
management, and quality management, as well as by cross-domain scenarios such as
Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) &amp; DevOps, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM), and
Integrated Service Management (ISM). Though the OSLC approach may apply to many
other domains and cross-domain scenarios, it focuses its efforts to ensure it meets
a core set of scenarios and requirements.</p>

<p>The OSLC Core specifications provide additional capabilities that
expand on the W3C LDP capabilities, as needed, to enable key integration scenarios. They define the essential
technical elements of OSLC domain specifications and offers guidance on common concerns for
creating, updating, retrieving, and linking to lifecycle resources based on W3C LDP [[LDP]].
These specifications have emerged from the best practices and other work of
other OSLC Member Section(MS)-affiliated Technical Committees (TCs), sometime referred to as OSLC domain TCs.  OSLC
domain TCs focus on a certain domain or topic.
The <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/apps/org/workgroup/oslc-core/">OSLC Core TC</a> develops technical specifications, creates
best practices documents and formulates design principles that can be leveraged by
other OSLC MS-affiliated TCs to enable them to focus on domain-specific concerns.</p>

  <!--  TODO: Consider upgrading picture to use UML notation: Packages, Dependencies, Components, ... (comment from Lonnie) -->
</figure>

<p>As seen in <a href="#fig-oslc-core-3.0-overview"></a>, there are a number of capabilities developed in different
standards organizations, TCs and working groups.  The arrows represent either dependencies or extensions to some specifications or
capabilities.  OSLC MS-affiliated TC developed specifications may depend on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications as scenarios motivate.
Though a leading goal is to minimize and eliminate unnecessary dependencies to simplify adoption, which may result in no dependency on OSLC Core 3.0 specifications.</p>

<p>This work is an evolution from the OSLC Core 2.0 [[OSLCCore2]] efforts, which takes the learning from that effort along
with the common foundation on W3C LDP, to produce an updated set of specifications that: are simpler, have
layered capabilities and easier to adopt.</p>

		<h2>Deprecated terms</h2>
		<p>In previous revisions of OSLC-based specifications [[OSLCCore2]],
			terminology used based that may longer be relevant, accurate or
			needed anymore. Some of those deprecated terms are:
		<dl class="glossary">
			<dt>Provider (<em>deprecated</em>)</dt>

			<dt>Consumer (<em>deprecated</em>)</dt>
			<dd>See Client [[HTTP11]].</dd>

		<h2>Goals/Motivation</h2>


		<em class='loc-heading'>Scenario-driven</em>
		<p>Every capability should be linked back to
			key integration scenarios that motivate its need. These are important
			not only for knowing that the correct specification content is being
			developed but also to assist with implementers understanding the
			intended usage.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Incremental</em>
		<p>Specifications should be developed in an incremental fashion
			that not only validates the technical approaches but also delivers
			integration value sooner.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Loose-coupling</em>
		<p>Specifications should support a model where clients have little
			to no knowledge about server implementation-specific behaviors in
			order to support key integration scenarios. As a result, clients
			should be unaffected by any server application software
			or data model implementation changes. Similarly, client software should be able to
			be independently changed without changes to server software.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Minimalistic</em>
		<p>Specification authors should strive to find not only the
			simplest solution that would work for a given scenario but allows for
			easy adoption. Authors should avoid
			solutions that offer additional capabilities which may inhibit adoption of
			necessary capabilities.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Capabilities</em>
		<p>A capability is aligned by some related scenarios or technologies.
		    Capabilities should be defined to be as independent as possible. The
			capabilities should be incrementally defined as independent focused specifications and
			independently discovered at runtime. Even though there may be some
			generally agreed upon best practices for capability publication
			and discovery, each
			capability should define how it is published and discovered.</p>

		<em class='loc-heading'>Vocabularies</em>
		<p>Various OSLC MS-affiliated TCs, or any specification development body that is
		authoring specifications for specific domains of knowledge, should minimally define
		vocabularies and the semantics behind the various terms.  Some global
		reuse considerations are when terms are used for cross domain queries and within
		other domain resource shape definitions.
		Domain specifications are
		the definition of an OSLC capability, and how those vocabulary terms are used in
		LDP interactions by both the clients and servers of that capability. The specification should
		include defining resource shapes that describe resources based on a set of vocabulary
		terms, which introduces any domain specific constraints on the vocabulary's usage.
		Domain vocabulary terms should be developed with global reuse in mind.</p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		<p>In support of the previously stated goals and motivation, it is desired to have a consistent and recommended architecture. The architecture needs to
		support scenarios where there needs to be a protocol to access, create, update and delete resources: LDP is the
		foundation for this [[LDP]]. These resources need to relate, or link,
		to one another utilizing a consistent, standard and web-scale data model: Resource Description Framework (RDF) [[rdf11-concepts]] is the foundation for this.  The
		ability to work with these data models over HTTP protocols, is based on [[LDP]].  </p>

		<p>Some scenarios, require the need to integrate user interface components: either within a desktop or mobile web-browser, mobile device
		application, or rich desktop applications.  For these scenarios, the technology is rapidly evolving and changing.  Priority should be
		based on existing standards such as HTML5, with use of <code>iframe</code> and <code>postMessage()</code>. [[HTML5]]</p>

		<p>Various OSLC Core specifications should elaborate on the conformance requirements leveraging these various technologies and
		approaches.</p>

		<p>As the primary goals have been outlined around lifecycle integration, some scenarios may require exploration of new (or different)
		approaches and technologies.  As with all specification development efforts, the OSLC Core TC will advise, develop and approve
		such efforts through the established processes for cross-TC and organization coordination.</p>

		<h2>Specification outline</h2>
		<p>Specifications follow the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">OASIS TC process</a> towards standardization and each OSLC-affiliated TC will make the determination
		which documents are needed and which should be on the standards-track.</p>
		<p>Specifications developed by OSLC-affiliated TCs should follow consistent structure and style, based on OASIS requirements.
		A <a href="http://sspeiche.github.io/respec/examples/oslc/template-spec.html">template</a> is available which provides the preferred structure and
		what is expected in various sections.</p>
