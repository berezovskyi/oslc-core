		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Sometimes there are various resources and properties that are so commonly used or apply so broadly
		that it makes sense to have a place to define them: this is that place.  Some common usages are short names or labels,
		error messages, discussion threads, traceability/impacts relationship behavior or annotating other vocabulary terms.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="terms">
		<h1>Terminology</h1>
		<p>Terminology is based on OSLC Core Overview [[OSLCCore3]], W3C Linked Data Platform [[LDP]], W3C's
			Architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]],  Hyper-text
			Transfer Protocol [[HTTP11]].</p>
		<dl>
			<dt class='loc-heading'><dfn>Archived Resource</dfn></dt>
			<dd>A resource in which an explicit action has been performed to mark the resource as no longer
			active and may be removed from typical user interactions.  As a consequence,
			an achieved resource should be considered immutable.</dd>
		</dl>
	</section>

	<section id="conformance">
	<p><em>TODO: needed for public review version of standards-track specifications, more details
	in <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/templates/TCHandbook/ConformanceGuidelines.html#_Toc170119664">TC Handbook</a>.
	Some examples: <a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/ldpwg/raw-file/default/ldp.html#conformance">LDP</a>,
	<a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/os-UBL-2.1/UBL-2.1.html#S-CONFORMANCE">UBL</a></em></p>
	</section>

	<section class='informative'>
		<h2>Motivation</h2>
		<p><a title="">Archived Resource</a>s are typically found in large systems in which an immutable copy of the state of a resource at a given time is captured.
		The purpose may vary in that it could be simply a way to provide a backup or snapshot in time of a resource, which gives ease of access to it through typical
		means.  Having a consistent way to indicate that a resource, or a set of them, has been archived helps when defining certain views of the resources or queries.
		Archived Resources are identified by having a triple in their resource representations as: <code>archivedResourceURI oslc:archived true</code>.</p>

		<p>Many different kinds of applications have a way to provide comments or notes related to a given resource.  These take the form of a discussion, with a sequence
		of comments.  As there are various applications that often need to easily add to a comment to a discussion thread or navigate a thread, it would be valuable to
		have a common way to express this discussion.</p>

		<p>Error responses from HTTP request often take the form of HTML pages intended for a human to read.  Though often times these requests are initiated from applications
		that don't have a human actively monitoring it.  Therefore having a consistent way to request error responses for a certain format and follow a prescribed model can
		help clients better handle errors automatically.</p>

		<p>Consider the user interface of a query builder that allows users to build queries about testcases. It is natural for the query builder to present the user with a
		list of the properties that apply to testcases. Suppose the user wants to build a query that returns all that requirements that are validated by a testcase. The query
		builder should describe the available properties from the point of view of the testcase. This implies that the query builder should describe the inverse relation
		asserted by any triple that has the testcase as an object. In this example, the query builder should describe oslc_rm:validatedBy as “validates”.</p>

		<p>Some RDF properties express dependency relations between artifacts, and it is often very valuable to trace the impact of a change in an artifact to those artifacts
		that depend on it directly or indirectly. The concept of dependency is very general. For example, the concept of trace relations is described in SysML:
		“A generic trace requirement relationship provides a general-purpose relationship between a requirement and any other model element. The semantics of trace include no real constraints and therefore are quite weak.”
		[[SysML]]  As a general guideline, if any triple that uses a given predicate may become invalid if the state of either its subject or object resources change, then we may legitimately regard that predicate as expressing
		a dependency relation, in which case it may be useful to explicitly describe the nature of the dependency.</p>

		<h2>Terms for describing vocabularies</h2>


		<section class='informative' id="invLabels">
			<h2>Inverse Labels</h2>

			<p>It should be noted that the use of inverse labels is independent of the existence of explicit RDF inverse properties.
			However, if an inverse property is defined by some vocabulary, then a consistent label should be used in order to avoid confusion.
			In general, it is good practice to avoid the creation of inverse properties since it complicates SPARQL queries. Instead, a single
			property should be wherever possible and it should be given an inverse label.</p>

		</section>


		<section class='informative'>
			<h2>Traceability and Impact type</h2>

			<p>In a dependency relationship, the dependent resource is said to be downstream from the artifact it depends on.
			The artifact it depends on is said to be upstream from the dependent artifact. This terminology reflects the normal
			flow of work in the sense that artifacts flow downstream where new dependent artifacts are created.</p>

			<p>For example, a requirement is said to be upstream from a testcase that validates it because the requirement is
			normally created before the testcase. Of course, it is possible that the testcase gets created first and then the
			requirement is abstracted from it. However, the conceptual relation between requirements and testcases is that
			requirements are prior and drive the creation of testcases.</p>

			<p>The property <code>oslc:impactType</code> asserts that the subject property is a dependency relation and gives
			the direction of impact. The resources <code>oslc:UpstreamImpact</code> and <code>oslc:DownstreamImpact</code> identify
			the upstream and downstream directions. In addition, <code>oslc:SymmetricImpact</code> describes a symmetric dependency
			relation in which there is no clear upstream or downstream direction. Finally, it may in some cases be useful to assert
			that two artifacts are independent. The latter is described using <code>oslc:NoImpact</code>.</p>

			<p>For example, the following triple (in Turtle notation) would be added a vocabulary:</p>

			<code><pre class='example'>ex:validatedBy oslc:impactType oslc:DownstreamImpact .</pre></code>

			<p>The following triples would be added to a vocabulary:</p>

			<code><pre class='example'>ex:validatesRequirement oslc:impactType oslc:UpstreamImpact .
ex:validatesRequirementCollection oslc:impactType oslc:UpstreamImpact.</pre></code>
